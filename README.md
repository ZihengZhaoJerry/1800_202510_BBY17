# Huh!

## Overview

This client-side JavaScript web application allows users to create, edit, delete, and search for posts about local slang, as well as comment on other users’ posts. Users receive real-time in-app notifications when someone comments on their post, enhancing engagement and interaction.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applied agile project management and user-centered design principles. It integrates Firebase Firestore to handle real-time updates and data synchronization for posts, comments, and notifications.
